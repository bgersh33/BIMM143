# RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB)

Protein structures by X-ray crystallography dominate this database. We are skipping Q1-3 as the website was too slow for us.

>Q4.  Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure?

We see just one atom per water molecule in this structure because the hydrogen atoms bonded to the oxygen atoms in water are too small to be picked up by the software's resolution. 

>Q5. There is a critical “conserved” water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have?

This critical "conserved" water molecule is the water molecule closest to the binding site of the ligand. The residue number of this water molecule is HOH308. 

>Q6. Generate and save a figure clearly showing the two distinct chains of HIV-protease along with the ligand. You might also consider showing the catalytic residues ASP 25 in each chain (we recommend “Ball & Stick” for these side-chains). Add this figure to your Quarto document.

##3. Introduction to Bio3D in R

Bio3D is an R package for structural bioinformatics. To use it we need to call it up with the 'library()' function (just like any package)

```{r}
library(bio3d)
```

To read a PDB file we can use 'read.pdb()
```{r}
pdb<-read.pdb("1hsg")
pdb
```

The ATOM records of a PDB file are stored in 'pdb$atom'
```{r}
head(pdb$atom)
```

>Q7: How many amino acid residues are there in this pdb object? 

198

>Q8: Name one of the two non-protein residues? 

MK1

>Q9: How many protein chains are in this structure?

# Comparative analysis of Adenylate kinase (ADK)

We will start our analysis with a single PDB id code (code from the PDB database): 1AKE

First we get it's primary sequence:
```{r}
aa<-aa <- get.seq("1ake_A")
```
```{r}
b <- blast.pdb(aa)
```
```{r}
hits <- plot(b)
```

>Q10. Which of the packages above is found only on BioConductor and not CRAN? 

msa
>Q11. Which of the above packages is not found on BioConductor or CRAN?: 

bio3d-view
>Q12. True or False? Functions from the devtools package can be used to install packages from GitHub and BitBucket? 

True
>Q13. How many amino acids are in this sequence, i.e. how long is this sequence?

214 amino acids

```{r}
hits <- NULL
hits$pdb.id <- c('1AKE_A','6S36_A','6RZE_A','3HPR_A','1E4V_A','5EJE_A','1E4Y_A','3X2S_A','6HAP_A','6HAM_A','4K46_A','3GMT_A','4PZL_A')
```

```{r}
files <- get.pdb(hits$pdb.id, path="pdbs", split=TRUE, gzip=TRUE)
```
```{r}
pdbs <- pdbaln(files, fit = TRUE, exefile="msa")
```

#Jump to PCA

```{r}
pc.xray <- pca(pdbs)
plot(pc.xray)
```
```{r}
pc1 <- mktrj(pc.xray, pc=1, file="pc_1.pdb")
# Calculate RMSD
rd <- rmsd(pdbs)

# Structure-based clustering
hc.rd <- hclust(dist(rd))
grps.rd <- cutree(hc.rd, k=3)

plot(pc.xray, 1:2, col="grey50", bg=grps.rd, pch=21, cex=1)
```

```{r}
pc1 <- mktrj(pc.xray, pc=1, file="pc_1.pdb")
```


```{r}
modes <- nma(pdbs)
plot(modes, pdbs, col=grps.rd)
```

>Q14. What do you note about this plot? Are the black and colored lines similar or different? Where do you think they differ most and why?

The black and colored lines are very different. I think that they differ the most in the binding-region because the protein would fluctuate between different confrontational states depending on presence or absence of the substrate.
